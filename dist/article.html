              <em>Ieper, Belgium, February 17, 2020</em> – The newest additions to Flint Group’s Catena
              Product
              family, the Catena-W , for Washer, and Catena-DL, for Dryer Light finisher, follow Flint
              Group’s promise of delivering solutions which are Better.Faster.Easier to use.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since Xeikon Pre-press joined the Flint Group Family in 2015 both Flint Group Flexographic
              and Xeikon Pre-press were suddenly in the very unique position to have the expertise in
              plate manufacturing and plate processing equipment in-house. This unique position in the
              industry resulted in a close collaboration between our R&D departments with the aim to
              provide a fully optimized Pre-press environment to our customers including equipment and
              plates. "We believe that no one in our industry can match this level of expertise and the
              first feedback we got from our beta customers is confirming our view", says Friedrich von
              Rechteren, Global Commercial VP, Flint Group Flexographic.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Catena-W is designed to deliver highest productivity through unique plate alignment
              which avoids plate skew during transport as well as an advanced plate queuing system. This
              limits the distance between plates being processed and maximizes the throughput. An
              integrated plate shuttle will enable a single operator to easily handle large format plates,
              and a minimum gap between queues will increase the number of plates processed per shift.
            </p>
            <p>
              Xeikon Pre-press R&D Director Bart Wattyn explains: “Right from the beginning our
              ThermoFlexX imaging systems were designed to help our customers through automation and
              leading edge technology. By listening to the challenges our customers have to face every
              day, like handling large size flexo plates that are easy to damage, we developed the
              Flextray with fully automatic loading and unloading. The positive feedback we received was
              tremendous! Consequently, we announced the Catena-E LED exposure system in 2019 with a fully
              automatic plate feed from our imagers. Plate processing (wash-out) gives an extra challenge
              and we took it as a design goal that an operator should be able to handle large plates,
              single handed and without ever having to come into contact with their solvent-wet surface”.
            </p>
            <p>
              Compared to other washers the Catena-W operates in a sealed environment. Its efficient
              extractions ensure a minimum of solvent fumes reaching the workplace, which benefits the
              health and safety of operators.

            <p>
              The Catena-DL features an automated lift that can be used to move a plate from the shuttle to
              the dryer drawers and into the light finishing section while avoiding any human touch point.
              Stefaan Herman, lead user and Site Manager at Miller-Graphics, a Brand Management, Repro and
              Flexo Plate making company specializing in flexible packaging, paper and foil, corrugated and
              labels, states:
            </p>
            <p>
              “We have a great deal of experience and pride ourselves on keeping pace with technical
              innovations. Choosing the right equipment is vital to keep our business ahead. We are always
              interested in Flint Group and especially ThermoFlexX developments and happy to take the
              opportunity to be the first customer installing the Catena-W and Catena-DL. We’ve found the
              Catena-W pin-bar system to be very useful. This avoids the need for punching the plate by using
              an external spiked clamp system. Not only does this save a step, it also means there’s no
              polymer residue from the punch that can sometimes stick on a plate. Furthermore, the distance
              required for clamping is less and, thus, saves us some plate material. Rather than a drive chain
              that passes through the solvent, Catena-W uses a leadscrew that’s outside the liquid, this saves
              a lot of maintenance. For the environment in our plate room, we noticed that special covers
              limit the solvent evaporation with almost no smell discernable in the room. The systems are
              noticeably quieter, too. Overall we believe that ThermoFlexX has definitely brought a literally
              fresh and extremely valuable approach to our business”.
